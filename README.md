# SPOT-IT-Game
Text-based game version of the game "Spot It". The premise is that there is a stack of cards each with 4 images on it, for any pair of cards taken out of the stack, they will only have one matching image. For each round of the game, a pair of cards are presented to two players, who are competing to guess the matching image before the other does. This project was made for a class assignment in the ISC4U computer science course.
